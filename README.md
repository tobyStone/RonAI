R work on AI

Work with a local tech company, Zengenti: https://www.zengenti.com/ -  and Joe Collins, there: https://github.com/joejcollins/melody-angel, to come up with ideas for using R and Artifical Intelligence on the sort of data they may encounter.

We discussed classification (binary and class) and linear regression, using both random data samples, and continous data from MNIST, IMDB, and the Boston Housing dataset.
